# Integration Guidelines

## Introduction
The ContentLibraryApp provides a set of APIs that allow third-party integrations to interact with the platform. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for integrating with the ContentLibraryApp API.

## Authentication
All API requests must be authenticated using an API key. To obtain an API key, please contact the ContentLibraryApp team. The API key should be included in the `Authorization` header of each request.

Example:

Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}


## Base URL
The base URL for all API requests is `https://api.contentlibraryapp.com`.

## Error Handling
The ContentLibraryApp API follows standard HTTP status codes for indicating the success or failure of a request. In case of an error, the API will return a JSON response with an error message.

Example error response:

{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}


## Rate Limiting
To ensure fair usage of the API, rate limiting is enforced. The rate limits are as follows:

- Free tier: 100 requests per hour
- Premium tier: 1000 requests per hour

If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will return a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Available Endpoints
The following endpoints are available for integration with the ContentLibraryApp API:

- `POST /api/content` - Create a new content item
- `PUT /api/content/{id}` - Update an existing content item
- `DELETE /api/content/{id}` - Delete a content item
- `GET /api/content/{id}` - Get details of a content item

Please refer to the individual endpoint documentation for more details on request and response formats.

## Request/Response Formats
The ContentLibraryApp API accepts and returns JSON data. All requests should include the `Content-Type: application/json` header.

Example request:

POST /api/content HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {API_KEY}

{
  "title": "Sample Content",
  "description": "This is a sample content item"
}


Example response:

{
  "id": "123456",
  "title": "Sample Content",
  "description": "This is a sample content item"
}


## Pagination
For endpoints that return multiple items, pagination is supported. The `page` and `limit` query parameters can be used to control the number of items returned per page and navigate through the results.

Example request with pagination:

GET /api/content?page=2&limit=10
