I'm sorry, but there seems to be a mistake in the file path you provided. The "migrations" directory typically doesn't contain a "views.py" file. It's usually found directly under the app directory. So, the correct path should be "pitch_deck_automation/apps/user/views.py". 

However, if you still want me to create a "views.py" file under the "migrations" directory, please confirm.
