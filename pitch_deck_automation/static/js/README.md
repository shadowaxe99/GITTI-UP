As a full-stack developer, I understand that the README.md file is not a code file but a markdown file used for documentation. However, following your command, here's a basic structure for a README.md file in the js directory:


# JavaScript Files for Pitch Deck Automation

This directory contains all the JavaScript files used in the Pitch Deck Automation project.

## main.js

This is the main JavaScript file for the project. It includes functions for template customization, real-time collaboration, automated analytics, revision control, content library, accessibility features, interactive elements, and data integration.

Please refer to the comments within the file for more detailed information about each function.
